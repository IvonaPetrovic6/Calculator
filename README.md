# Calculator
simple calculator

This program is written in C++ and works as a simple calculator (for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing both integers and decimal numbers).
It respects the correct order of mathematical operations, but still doesn't have a feature to solve the brackets first.
If anyone has an idea or time, feel free to comment/upgrade it.
